Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in the Biology program at New York University, adivised by Dr. Richard Bonneau.

I'm broadly interested in genomics, biological diversity, and evolutionary biology. See my Research page to know more about the ongoing and previous projects that I have worked on. I was born and grew up in [Lishui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lishui), China.

Below is a photo of my cat Luna. She is interested in shrimp, flashing lights, and all things moving fast.
