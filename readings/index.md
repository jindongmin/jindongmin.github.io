## *Akkermansia muciniphila*

## *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*
Thiamine (VB1) biosynthesis protein ThiC in *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* contains a inverton that introduces a premature stop codon when inverted. *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* have the capacity to biosynthesize thiamine while at a large energetic cost. This work showed that at human intestine thiamine concentrations (0.02-2 μM), strain with inverted inverton was more fit than the prototrophic strain. However, they found thiamine availability does not promote rapid *thiC* inverton flipping and the inversions are probably stochastic. It fits a [bet-hedging](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/article-abstract/276/1669/2963/72811/Bet-hedging-as-an-evolutionary-game-the-trade-off?redirectedFrom=fulltext) model.

*Scheiman et al. 2019* provides an example of a host-microbiome metabolic feedback loop, linking exercise-induced lactate to microbial propionate production and endurance performance. It's an interesting example of how exercise shape the gut microbiome.
